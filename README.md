# you-tube-ui

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features

This was my attempt at recreating YouTube's User Experience and User Interface with some key main features such as:

- [YouTube UI]() - it has a similar UI layout of components,pages,icons etc.
- [YouTube Videos]() - an interactive video player component to watch videos.
- [Search]() - a search component to select and preview a video.
- [Responsive Design]() - a desktop and mobile responsive layout

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn 
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


## Deploy on Vercel
